# 5-card-draw-royal-flush-odds-simulator

This program calculates the odds of getting a royal flush, assuming $1 is played per hand, by shuffling and drawing 5 random cards from the deck until it has gotten 1000 royal flushes. It will then output the average cost per royal flush, the highest cost royal flush, and the lowest cost royal flush.

I included a less verbose option (that is way less fun to watch) that is significantly faster.
